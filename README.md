# RBLXWILD DailyCase Exploit (PATCHED)

- ## Explanation
    #### By sending a request to open a daily case the server does not check if the case is a valid daily case meaning u could open any case like valk case. Fore **FREE**
    #### Server does not check if you have a specific level, because normal cases don't require a minimium level.
    #### Server does check if you have opened a daily case in 24hours meaning you can only open 1 case of choice per account

- ## Impact
    #### Close to a few million robux were already withdrawed before the staff would have noticed the damage
    #### Service down for a few hours
    #### Even after the service got back up over 100K robux in withdraws still went through

- ## Usage
    - Replace useragent with a random useragent
    - Replace authToken with your RBLXWILD authToken 
    - Replace session with your RBLXWILD session
    - Close your RBLXWILD tab and run the python script, after that wait a few seconds and it should have opened your case of choice
    #### For unknown reasons sometimes the script would fail but it seemed like fresh accounts would fail from time to time but being on the site for up to 10 minutes would fix it.
